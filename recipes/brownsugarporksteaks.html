                        </ul>

                    <p><strong>How to make it</strong></p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 F.</li>
                            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, Worcestershire, garlic, ketchup and brown sugar.
                                 Adjust this mixture to taste, some people like more ketchup along with the brown sugar. Once you have adjusted it to taste, move on to the next step.</li>
                            <li>Pat dry your pork steaks with a paper towel to remove any leftover moisture or blood from the packaging, then place the pork steaks in the bottom of a baking pan.
                                 Pour the sauce over the pork steaks.</li>
                            <li>Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pork steaks reach an internal temperature of 145 F.</li>
                            <li>Remove and serve. The sauce is excellent on rice!</li>
                        </ol>
