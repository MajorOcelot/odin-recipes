                <h3>Easy to make comfort food!</h3>

                    <p>Swedish style meatballs are quite a common dish in Sweden.  They are cheap and easy to make, fill you up and the recipe is scaleable!  Thankfully, they have also
                        become easy to find in the United States among other places.
                    </p>

                    <p>The only tools you will need are a mixing bowl, a grater, a knife, an ice cream scoop (a spoon will work, just try to keep sizes as consistent as possible for even cooking) and a pan (cast iron
                        is preferred but anything will work).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Beef AND pork - the beef gives it flavour, the pork gives it juiciness and tenderness;</li>
                            <li>Bread - the secret to extra soft meatballs! Far more effective than breadcrumbs;</li>
                            <li>Nutmeg and All Spice - the signature spicing, just a small, subtle amount. All Spice is a particular type of spice made from a plant called Pimenta dioica. It smells like cloves.
                                Itâ€™s a common spice found in normal supermarkets, and costs no more than usual spices. Best substitute is Mixed Spice.</li>
                            <li>Beef stock/broth and cream - for the creamy gravy;</li>
                            <li>Flour - to thicken the gravy;</li>
                            <li>Egg - for binding the meatballs together.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><strong>Here's how you make it:</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Meatballs</strong>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Grate onion using a standard box grater</li>
                                <li>Scrape onion and juices into bowl. Add bread and mix well - onion juice should make bread soggy (if not, add a tiny splash of milk). Set aside to soak for 1 minute.</li>
                                <li>Add remaining Meatball ingredients EXCEPT oil. Mix well.</li>
                                <li>Using a tablespoon measure and measure out a heaped tablespoon (or use ice cream scooper which is what I do), dollop on work surface.
                                    Repeat with remaining mixture: 25 - 30 meatballs. Then roll into shape.</li>
                                <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add half the meatballs and brown all over (but raw inside still) - about 3 minutes. Remove onto plate, then brown the remaining batch.</li>
                                <li>If there is lots of oil, pour off excess and discard. Lower heat to medium.</li>
                            </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Gravy</strong>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Add butter into skillet and melt. Add flour and stir in. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
                                <li>While mixing, add about 1/4 of the beef broth - it will thicken quickly. Then gradually add remaining beef broth, stirring as you go. Switch to whisk if required to make it lump free.</li>
                                <li>When the liquid is simmering, add meatball and juices pooled on plate.</li>
                                <li>Turn up heat slightly to keep it at a rapid simmer. Cook for 8 - 10 minutes or until the liquid thickens into a thin gravy, stirring occasionally.</li>
                                <li>Add cream, simmer for a further 2 minutes then remove from stove.</li>
                                <li>Serve over mashed potato (or Cauliflower Mash for low carb). For a truly authentic experience, add a dollop of ligonberry jam on the side!</li>
                            </ol>
