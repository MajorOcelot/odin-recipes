                <h3>Easy to make comfort food!</h3>

                    <p>Swedish style meatballs are quite a common dish in Sweden.  They are cheap and easy to make, fill you up and the recipe is scaleable!  Thankfully, they have also
                        become easy to find in the United States among other places.

                    <p>The only tools you will need are a mixing bowl, a knife, an ice cream scoop (a spoon will work, just try to keep sizes as consistent as possible for even cooking) and a pan (cast iron
                        is preferred but anything will work).

                    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Beef AND pork - the beef gives it flavour, the pork gives it juiciness and tenderness;</li>
                            <li>Bread - the secret to extra soft meatballs! Far more effective than breadcrumbs;</li>
                            <li>Nutmeg and All Spice - the signature spicing, just a small, subtle amount. All Spice is a particular type of spice made from a plant called Pimenta dioica. It smells like cloves.
                                Itâ€™s a common spice found in normal supermarkets, and costs no more than usual spices. Best substitute is Mixed Spice.</li>
                            <li>Beef stock/broth and cream - for the creamy gravy;</li>
                            <li>Flour - to thicken the gravy;</li>
                            <li>Egg - for binding the meatballs together.</li>
                        </ul>
