The Odin Project | Project: Recipes

<!-- This project's purpose is to build my skills using HTML to build basic but functional websites.  The goal is to use all of the skills I have learned so far during the Odin Project to complete this project.

The website will show an index page as well as a few pages to some different recipes.

Completing this project will showcase my basic understanding of how to set up a Github repository, clone the repository to my local machine, set up the needed directories for the project and writing HTML code to build a functional website!>
